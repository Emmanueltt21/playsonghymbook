PlaySongsHymBook â€“ Senior Android Development Task Sheet

Project Overview

App Name: PlaySongsHymBookGoal: A bilingual (EN/FR) hymnbook with builtâ€‘in audio player, quick number grid (1â€“400), swipeable hymn details, favorites, search, and a bottom navigation home.Platform: Android (Phone + small tablets)Tech Stack: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM + Repository, Room, ExoPlayer, DataStore, Hilt (or Koin), Coil, Navigation ComposeTarget SDK: 35Min SDK: 24Build Tools: Gradle KTS + Version CatalogCI/CD: GitHub Actions (assemble, lint, unit/UI tests, Play upload optional)

Data Source Description

Songs will be loaded into the local database from a hymns_raw.json file.

For initial testing/sample data, create a list of 5 popular old hymns.

Raw assets folder should be created to contain hymn songs, labeled as 1en.mp3, 1fr.mp3 for hymn number 1 (English and French versions respectively), and similarly for other hymns.

JSON structure example:

[
  {
    "number": 1,
    "titleEn": "Amazing Grace",
    "titleFr": "GrÃ¢ce Ã‰tonnante",
    "lyricsEn": "Amazing grace! How sweet the sound...",
    "lyricsFr": "GrÃ¢ce Ã©tonnante! Quel doux son...",
    "audioEn": "1en.mp3",
    "audioFr": "1fr.mp3"
  },
  {
    "number": 2,
    "titleEn": "Holy, Holy, Holy",
    "titleFr": "Saint, Saint, Saint",
    "lyricsEn": "Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty...",
    "lyricsFr": "Saint, saint, saint! Seigneur Tout-Puissant...",
    "audioEn": "2en.mp3",
    "audioFr": "2fr.mp3"
  }
  // ...add 3 more hymns for sample data
]

Data Model & Storage

Entities (Room)

Hymn(
  id: Long,
  number: Int,
  titleEn: String,
  titleFr: String,
  lyricsEn: String,
  lyricsFr: String,
  audioUrlEn: String?, // or local asset key
  audioUrlFr: String?, // or local asset key
  lastViewedAt: Long?,
  isFavorite: Boolean = false
)

Optional FTS table: HymnFts(content=lyricsEn|lyricsFr|titleEn|titleFr) for fast full-text search.

DAOs

HymnDao: getByNumber, search(query, locale), recent(limit), favorites(), updateFavorite(), updateLastViewed()

HymnFtsDao: full-text search with ranking

Preferences (DataStore)

language (en|fr), theme, fontScale, autoplay, rememberPosition

Audio

ExoPlayer with CacheDataSource (SimpleCache) for offline replay

Support local raw/asset files fallback when remote unavailable

Architecture

MVVM + Repository with UseCases (optional for complex logic)

Presentation (Compose Screens & ViewModels)
   â†• StateFlow/UiState
Domain (UseCases, Models)
   â†• Repository
Data (Room, DataStore, Asset/Remote Audio, ExoPlayer)

Modules (nice-to-have split)

core-ui, core-data, feature-home, feature-list, feature-details, feature-favorites, feature-settings, app

Navigation

Routes: home, list, favorites, settings, details/{number}

Deep links: playsongs://hymn/{number}

Back stack behavior: Details preserves player position (if enabled)

UI/UX & Design System

Material 3

Typography tuned for hymn readability; dynamic type

Card-based recent hymns; large numeric grid buttons (min 44dp)

Player mini-bar collapsible on Details; full controls on expand

Haptics: light impact on grid tap & favorite toggle

Acceptance Criteria (per feature)

Open by Number: Tapping any grid number opens Details for that hymn within 150ms on a Moto G-class device.Swipe Navigation: Horizontal swipe changes hymn number Â±1 with a 200ms transition and preserves scroll position in lyrics.Audio Playback: Play/Pause/Seek works; buffering indicator shown; resumes from saved position if enabled.Search: Queries by number/title/lyrics; returns localized results; debounced 300ms; shows empty state.Favorites: Toggling favorite persists; appears in Favorites screen and Details button reflects state.Localization: Switching EN/FR immediately updates UI strings and displayed hymn content; persisted across restarts.Recents: Last 3 hymns open appear on Home in reverse chronological order.

Data Ingestion Plan

Source format: hymns_raw.json with sample 5 hymns initially

Validator script: Checks number range, missing titles/lyrics, placeholder detection

Seeder: On first run, import into Room; build FTS index

Audio mapping: Map audio_key â†’ local asset file (1en.mp3, 1fr.mp3 etc.)

Technical Decisions

Paging: Not required for 400 items; use LazyColumn/LazyVerticalGrid

Swipe Implementation: Pager from Accompanist or Compose Foundation Pager

Search: Room LIKE + FTS for lyrics relevance; highlight matches in results (optional)

DI: Hilt for ViewModel/Repo/Player

Error Handling: Typed domain errors â†’ UI states; retry affordances

State Management: Single-source UiState via StateFlow; immutable data classes

Caching: ExoPlayer SimpleCache (100â€“200MB) with LRU eviction
